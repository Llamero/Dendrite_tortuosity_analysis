# ImageJ version compatibility

NOTE: The macros were originally written for ImageJ 1.52p, and some of the macros are unfortunately no longer compatible with later versions of ImageJ 1.52 or 1.53. Reverting to ImageJ 1.51w by going to Help->Update ImageJ and selecting “1.51” restores functionality for the "Create dendrite masks.ijm" and "Spiral and linear tortuosity simulator - supplemental movie.ijm" macros. This issue specifically involves changes in the implementation of raw FFT power spectrums and “Fill Holes” in the latest ImageJ versions.

"Tortuosity grid analysis - draft 4 - 1_53 compatible.ijm" has been updated to be compatible with ImageJ 1.53j.
