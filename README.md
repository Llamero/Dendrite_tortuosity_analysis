NOTE: The macros are unfortunately no longer compatible with later versions of ImageJ 1.52 or 1.53. Reverting to ImageJ 1.51w by going to Help->Update ImageJ and selecting “1.51” restores macro functionality. This issue specifically involves changes in the implementation of raw FFT power spectrums and “Fill Holes” in the latest ImageJ versions.
